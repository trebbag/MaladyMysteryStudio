The signature gadget is a pager that never stops, driving rapid triage and time-stamped HUD ‘exhibits.’ Motifs: signal vs noise; protocol vs intuition. | Detective Cyto Kine — felt lead investigator with HUD visor and evidence vial; narrates physiology as infrastructure and courtroom evidence., Deputy Pip — felt field deputy with micro-scanner; action-forward, asks learner questions, triggers clue reveals through curiosity without being incompetent., ED Charge Nurse (supporting) — embodies protocol under pressure; keeps the ‘court’ moving during the night shift., The Patient (adult with diabetes, respected) — initially stable with subtle complaints; later decompensates during a key decision point., Antagonist archetype: a hidden comorbidity — chronic kidney impairment/volume depletion/NSAID exposure (kept ambiguous early) that distorts signals, raises hypoglycemia risk, and accelerates vascular injury., ICD (Internal Calamity Directorate) — faint breadcrumb: a standardized “Basement Membrane” stamp appears in multiple ‘exhibits’ on the HUD, hinting at a larger conspiracy. | If Cyto and Pip misread noisy ED data and skip systematic surveillance, the patient risks preventable blindness (retinopathy), irreversible kidney decline (DKD), limb-threatening infection/Charcot collapse (foot disease), and fatal macrovascular events—while acute hypoglycemia/AKI can trigger immediate harm during the shift. Winning requires triage-first action, correct workup checklists, and a prevention bundle that prioritizes hypoglycemia safety and organ protection.",
